## History
When we started mob programming we originally used a phone timer to time the rotation. The timer played some music and then we rotated, however as the problems we worked on became more difficult we noticed people were unwilling to give up the keyboard. We then did a retrospective and resolved to get a louder and more annoying timer. This worked great as the mob did not want to listen to this loud and annoying timer very long. We then quickly found out that no one else in the office wanted to hear it either. We needed a solution that was quiet, yet encouraged the developers at the keyboard to rotate without ignoring the rotation time. Here is where the mob programming timer was born. The first mob programming timer was written in dot net. We then quickly had people ask about multi-platform options which is now why the python version of the mob programming timer exists today.
