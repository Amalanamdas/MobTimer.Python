Team members looking at phones too much? Try reducing the timer duration.
One team member navigating too much? Try navigating a new navigator who navigates the driver.
Need to normalize the skill level of the team? Try doing TDD Katas together.
Arguing about solutions? Try going with the least experienced navigator and have the more experienced team members course correct only as needed.
Taking too much time on complex solutions? Try starting with the simplest thing that can work.
Feeling like your skills are exposed to the team? Ask for help on improving them. Make it a safe environment for continuous improvement.
Working together is fun and effective!
